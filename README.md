# Challenge 3: Random Password Generator

## Description

The goal of this challenge was to build a random password generator using lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers and special characters.

## Usage

Upon clicking the 'Generate Password' button, the user is first asked to enter the length of their password and is then prompted to confirm whether their password should contain lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, or special characters. After validating these options, the random password will print within the 'Your Secure Password' box.
